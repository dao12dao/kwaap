* Easy to use UI
* Easy on bandwidth (for users with low bandwidth/limited data plans)
* Easy to read code, with required comments/documentation
* Use as much HTML5 and CSS3 as possible

Known bugs:

Installation instructions:

4. Have fun.

How to contribute:
This is a project made for the sole purpose of getting myself acquainted with PHP. If you find my code useful, don't hesitate to contribute to the code.

Create a github account, fork the repository, and send me a pull request whenever you think the changes are ready.

Otherwise, you can get me on irc.freenode.net, nick: execat (predictable!)
